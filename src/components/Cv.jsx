      <h2>Personal statement</h2>
      <p>
        I am someone who embraces life-long learning and in previous jobs
        stumbled into programming as a way to solve issues at work. I found the
        opportunities to code the most engaging part of my job, but they didn’t
        come around often enough. So when the opportunity arose to take
        voluntary redundancy I felt the time was right to leave. There’s been a
        bit of a gap between my previous employment and joining Northcoders. In
        this time I’ve renovated and sold a house and taught myself Python using
        online resources and books. Ultimately I decided it was time to join a
        coding boot-camp because I felt I needed the guidance of experienced
        developers to ensure I had the skills needed to begin a career as a
        software developer.
