      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Adrian, and I'm a software developer based in Leeds.</p>
      <p>
        After graduating from Leeds University where I studied chemistry, I went
        to work for Leeds City Council where I held multiple roles over the
        years. During this time, I began to develop my data analysis and
        programming skills and spent several years working alongside web
        developers and content professionals producing the council's many
        websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I left the council, I took a year out to reconsider my career
        options, bought, renovated and sold a house, but ultimately came back to
        programming as I had always enjoyed that aspect of my previous jobs the
        most, and I really missed working as part of a team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to become a software developer, and began to learn Python. I
        took a few online courses and went through some books, but felt that it
        wasn't enough to give me the confidence to start applying for positions.
        That's when I decided to join Northcoders' software development bootcamp
        where I learned key programming languages and frameworks such as
        JavaScript, React, and Express.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm now excited to pursue a career in software development and put my
        skills and experience to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy coding personal projects, rock climbing, and
        practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
